Explain the warning
Here's a breakdown of the warning and how to address it:

Line Endings and the Warning:

LF (Line Feed) is the standard line ending character on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS).
CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) is the standard on Windows.
Git is warning you that it has detected LF endings in these files, but your Git configuration is set to change them to CRLF the next time Git interacts with them (e.g., commit, pull, merge).
Potential Issues:

File Differences: Unnecessary changes can show up in Git when line endings differ, even if file content is unchanged.
Unexpected Behavior: Different line endings can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in text editors or tools.
Resolving the Warning:

Check Git Configuration:
Run git config core.autocrlf to see the current setting:
true: Git will convert LF to CRLF on Windows checkouts.
input: Git will convert CRLF to LF on commit.
false: No conversion will happen.
Choose a Consistent Line Ending:
Project-wide: Consider standardizing on LF for cross-platform compatibility.
Windows-specific: If files are intended for Windows only, CRLF might be appropriate.
Adjust Git Settings:
For LF (Unix-style):
git config --global core.autocrlf false
For CRLF (Windows-style):
git config --global core.autocrlf true
Convert Existing Files (if needed):
Use tools like dos2unix or unix2dos to convert line endings in bulk.
Additional Considerations:

.gitattributes: Use this file to specify line ending settings for specific file types or paths.
Text Editor Settings: Ensure your text editor is configured to use the desired line endings.
Team Coordination: If collaborating, agree on a standard line ending convention within the team.
By addressing these line ending inconsistencies, you'll maintain a clean Git history and avoid potential cross-platform issues.

Is there any problem if git converts it to clrf what are the drawbacks.
Here are the potential drawbacks of Git converting LF to CRLF:

1. Cross-Platform Inconsistencies:

Code Behavior: CRLF in code files can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or errors on Unix-based systems, especially in scripts or code that relies on specific line ending handling.
Difficult Debugging: Debugging issues arising from line ending differences can be challenging, as the root cause might not be immediately apparent.
2. Git History Issues:

Unnecessary Changes: Git might detect line ending changes as actual file modifications, even if the content hasn't changed, leading to:
Artificially inflated commit counts.
Difficulties in tracking meaningful changes.
Merge conflicts due to line ending differences between branches.
3. Tool Compatibility:

Unix-Based Tools: Some Unix-based tools might not work as expected with CRLF line endings, causing errors or formatting issues.
Git Operations: Certain Git commands might behave differently with CRLF, potentially leading to unexpected results.
4. Collaboration Challenges:

Mixed Environments: If a project involves developers working on different operating systems, inconsistent line endings can introduce merge conflicts and make collaboration more difficult.
5. Potential Corruption:

Binary Files: Git's line ending conversion can inadvertently corrupt binary files (e.g., images, compressed archives) if they're incorrectly identified as text files.
In general, it's recommended to standardize on LF line endings for cross-platform compatibility and a cleaner Git history. If CRLF is necessary for specific Windows-only files, consider using the .gitattributes file to manage those exceptions.

Exit codes give us an idea of how a process got terminated/the reason behind termination. 

A few of them are:

Uncaught fatal exception - (code - 1) - There has been an exception that is not handled
Unused - (code - 2) - This is reserved by bash
Fatal Error - (code - 5) - There has been an error in V8 with stderr output of the description
Internal Exception handler Run-time failure - (code - 7) - There has been an exception when bootstrapping function was called
Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure - (code - 4) - There has been an exception when the bootstrapping process failed to return function value when evaluated
